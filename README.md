**Lake Erie Abatement Optimization**

Excessive nutrient loading to Lake Erie (LE) has been identified as a major threat to the ecosystems and human populations in and around LE. Governments across the Canada-US border have established phosphorus loading reductions, including targeting the Western and LE Basins.

We present an optimization model for the Canadian side of Lake Erie (LE) that determines the required abatement level of total phosphorus (TP), targeting agricultural activities and additional investments in end-of-pipe technologies in wastewater treatment plants across the Canadian LE watersheds, such that a target reduction in P concentration is achieved at the lowest cost.

The hydrological model used in this study considers the interdependence among six regions: St. Claire River and Lake, the Detroit River, and the Western, Central and Eastern Basins of LE.
